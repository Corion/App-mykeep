# NAME

App::mykeep - notes kitchen

# Data model

Currently we have the following fields

    id
    title
    text
    bgcolor
    modifiedAt
    archivedAt
    lastSyncedAt

Maybe this should be moved to its own module. Later.

Future keys might become

    hasReminder / reminderICal - for reminders and their ICal calendar entry
